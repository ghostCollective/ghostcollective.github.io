I am a Data Steward in the VU University Library and have a background in history. I consult researchers about good Data Management practices for their research and try to promote Open Science along the way. One of my most successful moments at work was when a researcher concluded that writing good documentation is not just good for reproducibility purposes, but would also make it easier for them to remind themselves what they did.

I work as an OS & RDM training coordinator at the VU University Library with a background in Library & Information Science. Supporting researchers by providing training so that they can help themselves is essential for my job, but I believe that training does not necessarily need to be bland and boring. Developing GHOST gamified training resources was not only a great learning experience for myself, but also helps to make our workshops more attractive and to raise awareness around OS, RDM, and Software Management.

- Favourite game: Dominion
- Contributed to: Software Horror Escape Room, Open Science Against Humanity, Open Loves Science

I am a Data Steward & OS advocate at the VU University Library. Together with my colleague I provide courses on Writing a Data Management Plan, Open Science and all sorts of RDM affiliated subjects. As long as your question is not substantially about your research itself, I can probably help you further. Fun fact: I've never won Dominion, even though it is my favorite game.

I’ve been involved in the _Horror Weeks_ since 2019, back when I was working at Utrecht University. I remember a meeting with colleagues from Utrecht and TU Delft where we discussed the international _Love Data Week_. We couldn’t help but laugh at how cheesy it was—it was obvious we needed a darker, edgier counterpart. That’s when the idea for _Data Horror Week_ was born. In the end of October 2019, we launched a national awareness campaign: a week-long social media campaign featuring stories from researchers about research data management (RDM) disasters, and the valuable lessons learned from those missteps.

When I moved to VU Amsterdam in 2020, I was excited to carry the idea forward. I envisioned expanding _Data Horror Week_ into a fun and engaging national campaign. Of course, 2020 had other plans—everything had to go digital. But then Elisa Rondenburg came up with a brilliant idea: an online Escape Room. Thanks to connections we built in 2019, we managed to set up a collaboration between several institutions, and by Halloween, we had this fun and educative game ready to go. It was such a hit that we couldn’t stop there, and it sparked years of creative projects, combining *horror* RDM and Open Science in playful and engaging ways.
