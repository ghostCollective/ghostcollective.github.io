I (almost) have a PhD in archaeological sciences, and I work as a Data Steward at TU Delft. I enjoy
promoting Open Science in my field and applying OS practises to my own research, as well as training researchers to use
tools that can make their work more reproducible.

I am a Data Steward in the VU University Library and have a background in history. I consult researchers about good Data Management practices for their research and try to promote Open Science along the way. One of my most successful moments at work was when a researcher concluded that writing good documentation is not just good for reproducibility purposes, but would also make it easier for them to remind herself what they did.
