- title: "Open Séance"
  description: |
    In Open Séance, two teams compete in a game that is all about picking the right Open Spirits
    to communicate to while avoiding the ones that are bad for you. Each team has one Medium whose
    task it is to guide their team members through the Séance. Only the Mediums know which of the
    Open Spirits are FAIR to their team. With that knowledge, it is their task to describe the
    Open Science concepts that these spirits represent. However, their hints have to be brief,
    leaving plenty of room for creativity and sharp insights! The team who guesses all their Open
    Spirits correctly wins this spooky game. But beware of the evil ☠️ Publish-Geist!
