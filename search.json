I enjoy promoting Open Science in my field and applying OS practises to my own research, as well as training researchers to use tools that can make their work more reproducible.\n\n\nStefan Kirsch\n\nAffiliation: Tilburg University\nRole: GHOST member, Data Steward\nORCID: 0009-0009-6939-411X\nFavourite game: Dixit\nContributed to: Open Science Against Humanity, Open ♥ Science\n\nI have a PhD in Mechanical Engineering and I support researchers with scientific software engineering as well as making their workflows reproducible.\n\n\nElisa Rodenburg\n\nAffiliation: Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam\nRole: GHOST member, Data Steward\nORCID: 0000-0001-6068-9792\nFavourite game: Beverbende or Beaver Gang\nContributed to: Data Horror Escape Room, Open Science Escape Room, Software Horror Escape Room, Open Science Against Humanity and Open Loves Science\n\nI am a Data Steward in the VU University Library and have a background in history. I consult researchers about good Data Management practices for their research and try to promote Open Science along the way. One of my most successful moments at work was when a researcher concluded that writing good documentation is not just good for reproducibility purposes, but would also make it easier for them to remind themselves what they did.\n\n\nStephanie van de Sandt\n\nAffiliation: Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam\nRole: GHOST member, Training Coordinator\nORCID: 0000-0002-9576-1974\nFavourite game: Mansions of Madness, Sleeping Gods, Castles of Burgundy, … my game collection on BGG\nContributed to: Software Horror Escape Room, Open Science Against Humanity, Open Loves Science\n\nI work as an OS & RDM training coordinator at the VU University Library with a background in Library & Information Science. Supporting researchers by providing training so that they can help themselves is essential for my job, but I believe that training does not necessarily need to be bland and boring. Developing GHOST gamified training resources was not only a great learning experience for myself, but also helps to make our workshops more attractive and to raise awareness around OS, RDM, and Software Management."
